=======

Angular project generated by Yeoman which uses Karma and Protractor tests. As part of a coding challenge to demonstrate my knowledge of front-end application development, languages and tools. 

Makes use of Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, NPM, Angular, Bootstrap, SASS, Protractor and Karma.

Simple application to allow user to filter results using a search bar and sort results in ascending or descending order using star rating. 

Tested using Karma and Protractor end to end tests.

Run npm install to get things up and running, by running command:

To see website:

$ grunt serve

To run protractor tests:

$ npm install -g protractor
$ npm install -g webdriver-manager
$ webdriver-manager update --standalone
$ webdriver-manager start

Then from within project directory (in here automatically detects protactor.conf.js):
$ protractor 

(or run from anywhere but specify locatoin of protractor.conf.js file)

To run karma unit tests:

$ npm install --save-dev karma karma-mocha karma-chai karma-phantomjs-launcher
$ grunt test

Any issues let me know I'll get them fixed!
