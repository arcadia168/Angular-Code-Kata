# angular-code-kata
Angular project generated by Yeoman which uses Karma and Protractor tests. As part of a coding challenge when applying for a job.

Run npm install to get things up and running, by running command:

To see website:

$ grunt serve

To run protractor tests:

$ npm install -g protractor
$ npm install -g webdriver-manager
$ webdriver-manager update --standalone
$ webdriver-manager start

Then from within project directory (in here automatically detects protactor.conf.js):
$ protractor 

(or run from anywhere but specify locatoin of protractor.conf.js file)

To run karma unit tests:

$ npm install --save-dev karma karma-mocha karma-chai karma-phantomjs-launcher
$ grunt test

Any issues let me know I'll get them fixed!
